                     <h3>WHAT IS THE BEST MATTRESS FOR BACK PAIN?</h3>
                     <p> Based on findings, medium-firm foam mattresses are perfect for those suffering back pain.
                       A middle firm mattress is ideal for this type of sleeper. For side sleepers, a mattress
                        with slight softness is necessary to cushion the shoulders and hips. Stomach sleepers 
                        (who very likely sleep this way because of lower back pain) need a firmer mattress to 
                        keep them afloat. Fortunately for our customers, Bernico has all it takes to satisfy them.</p>

                      <p>In contrast, when sleeping on a firm innerspring bed, you can sometimes see or feel a space 
                      between your lower back and the mattress, meaning your lower back is not supported. but Bernico
                       foam makes certain that this doesn’t happen cos it’s going to give you your money’s worth.
                      </p>

                      <h3>HOTELS AND MATTRESSES</h3>
                     <p> Innerspring coil mattresses are the leading type of mattress used in hotels. They are affordable and durable.
                        Some of the innerspring mattresses feature a foam pillow top for extra comfort. However, many hotels 
                        such as Marriot and some Hilton hotels, according to some sources have switched exclusively to foam 
                        mattresses.</p>
                       
                      <h3>BE SENSITIVE</h3> 
                      <p>What you’re wearing, your bedroom temperature, how much your partner snore, or if you use electronics in
                         bed all impact how well you sleep each night, but the single biggest is one that you might not think 
                         about - your mattress. The truth is, whether you wake up feeling rested and ready to start the day 
                         depends largely on the age of your mattress and its current condition.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        if your mattress is older than seven years, it’s time
                         to check to be sure it’s still giving you the comfort 
                         and support you need for a good night’s sleep, a good mattress 
                        should relieve pressure on your joints and your body
                         (and NOT cause pain). As your mattress ages, it loses 
                         the ability to do this and your sleep quality gradually
                         declines. This happens so slowly, you may not even 
                         realise it. You might have to do a little detective work
                          to put up the pieces together. Maybe your hips are 
                          killing you, you can’t get comfortable at night, 
                          and you’re waking up exhausted. And this to the fact 
                          that your mattress is seven or more years old and bingo,
                          you’ve figured out the problem is not your body falling
                          apart, but your mattress telling you it’s ready to retire.
                          An aching back is one of the biggest signs it’s time to 
                          replace your current mattress
                      </p>
                      <h3>FINDING A BED MATE</h3>   
                      <p>When you’re ready to replace your mattress, you might not know
                         what you want or what you should look for. There are a 
                         wide variety of mattresses available incorporating different
                        materials and technologies that meet your budget and your needs.
                        We are aware of all these that’s why we introduced Bernico foam 
                        because it’s affordable and reliable.</p>
                       <h3>MATTRESS DURATION</h3> 
                       <p>How long your mattress lasts depends on how often it’s used and
                          needs to be replaced. While this is a good rule of 
                          thumb, everyone’s body changes over time and your need for comfort
                          and support increases as you age. Your weight could also be a significant
                          factor in the lifespan of your foam. For instance, someone who’s size 14, 
                          16 or even more can’t be compared to one who’s size 12, 10 or even less.
                          What we’re saying in essence is that your weight affects the duration or
                          the lifespan of your foam. Your body may be ready for a new matress before
                           the seven-year mark, so listen to what it’s telling you
                          </p>
                          <h3>EXAMINE YOUR MATTRESS</h3>
                          <p>Good sleep is so important for your health, productivity and ability to feel your best. Check in with your mattress regularly to find out if you need replacement. You may not even be aware your mattress has gotten old and worn until you think about it.
                             These are signs you may need a new mattress and 
                             foundation.
                             <ul>
                             <li>You wake up with stiffness, numbness, aches and pains.</li>
                             <li>You realize you got a better night’s sleep somewhere other than your own bed (such as a hotel).</li> 
                              <li>Your mattress shows physical signs of overuse (it sags, has visible tearing, ripping, holes, staining or damage).</li>
                              <li>You’re usually tired despite getting a full night’s sleep.</li>
                             <li>Your mattress is seven years old or older</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            </p>
                            <p>In a 2011 poll, the National Sleep Foundation found that 92 percent of 
                              people say a comfortable mattress is important to good
                               night’s sleep. You might be tempted to blame your budget
                                for continuing to doze on a less-than ideal mattress,
                                 but considering just a little bit more shut-eye can 
                                 help you lose weight, improve your memory and live longer,
                                  can you really put a price tag on good sleep? But the wrong mattress -
                                   or the mattress that’s simply too old -
                                   can be the cause of more than that crick in your neck or your low back pain.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>In a small 2009 study, 59 healthy men and women slept for 
                                    28 concecutive nights on their regular mattressess, then another 28 nights on new, medium-firm mattresses. They were asked to evaluate their stress levels based on facors like worrying, racing thoughts, nervousness, irritalbility, headaches, trembling and more. the new beds resulted in “a significant decrease in stress,” according to the study, possibly because of the related increase in sleep quality 
                                    and decrease in pain associated with the firmer setup.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                                  <p>Getting a good night’s sleep is an art and a science, and your mattress plays a huge role in determining the quality of your night’s rest. The bed is the place where you relax away the cares of the day and find 
                                    the rest that your body has been longing for all day.
